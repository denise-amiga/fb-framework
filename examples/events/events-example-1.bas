  Example 1: Basic event handling.
  
  This example shows how you can use events to establish communication between
  two classes. Events are like an abstract function call: the sender of the
  event doesn't know how many listeners there are for its events, it just
  raises it and all listeners that subscribed for handling the event will
  receive the notification.
'/

/'
  These two classes represent the arguments forwarded to the event
  handlers upon raising of an event. Note that both derive from
  'EventArgs', as there is some internal data that also needs to
  be forwarded with the event. Concretely, there is a pointer to
  the class that will handle the event ('Me'), to be able to
  reference its members (event handlers are static so you don't get
  the 'this' parameter passed to them).
'/
type _
  OperationCompletedEventArgs _
  extends Events.EventArgs
  
  declare constructor( _
    byval as integer )
  declare destructor() override
  
  as integer _
    someData
end type

constructor _
  OperationCompletedEventArgs( _
    byval aSomeData as integer )
  
  someData => aSomeData
end constructor

destructor _
  OperationCompletedEventArgs()
end destructor

type _
  SomethingHappenedEventArgs _
  extends Events.EventArgs
  
  declare constructor( _
    byref as string )
  declare destructor() override
  
  as string _
    message
end type

constructor _
  SomethingHappenedEventArgs( _
    byref aMessage as string )
  
  message => aMessage
end constructor

destructor _
  SomethingHappenedEventArgs()
end destructor

/'
  Here we describe an object that will perform two operations that
  raise events. Both events are exposed to the client code through
  readonly properties.
'/
type _
  Object1 _
  extends Events.WithEvents
  
  public:
    declare constructor( _
      byref as const string )
    declare destructor() override
    
    declare property _
      OperationCompleted() _
      byref as const Events.Event
    declare property _
      SomethingHappened() _
      byref as const Events.Event
    
    declare property _
      name() as string
    
    declare sub _
      operation1()
    declare sub _
      operation2()
    
  private:
    declare constructor()
    
    /'
      Events are ALWAYS static, like this
    '/
    static as Events.Event _
      _EvOperationCompleted
    static as Events.Event _
      _EvSomethingHappened
    
    as string _
      _name
    
    /'
      And this is some internal state of the object, that will be
      exposed to listeners of the 'OperationCompleted' event.
    '/
    as integer _
      _someInternalState => -4
end type

/'
  Events are declared like this (they are static vars).
  
  Note that you can also name them if you like. This can help in debugging
  and implementing other schemes. Names are not really needed (events are
  discriminated by their internal ids only).
'/
dim as Events.Event _
  Object1._EvOperationCompleted => _
    Events.Event()
dim as Events.Event _
  Object1._EvSomethingHappened => _
    Events.Event( "SomethingHappened" )
  
constructor _
  Object1()
end constructor

constructor _
  Object1( _
    byref aName as const string )
  
  /'
    Registering the events will assign them a unique id, which other classes
    will use to hook event handlers for them.
    
    Event registration will happen just once, the very first time a class of
    this type is instantiated.
  '/
  register( _EvOperationCompleted )
  register( _EvSomethingHappened )
  
  _name => aName
end constructor

destructor _
  Object1()
end destructor

/'
  And this is how you can expose events to the client code through
  readonly properties. Note that, to be able to discriminate the
  instance of the class we're going to subscribe the listener for,
  we return the static event through the 'forInstance' method, and
  pass it a pointer to the instance itself.
'/
property _
  Object1.OperationCompleted() _
  byref as const Events.Event
  
  return( _
    _EvOperationCompleted.forInstance( @this ) )
end property

property _
  Object1.SomethingHappened() _
  byref as const Events.Event
  
  return( _
    _EvSomethingHappened.forInstance( @this ) )
end property

property _
  Object1.name() _
  as string
  
  return( _name )
end property

/'
  The two operations the 'Object1' class implement will raise different
  events, and pass them different event arguments.
'/
sub _
  Object1.operation1()
  
  ? "Performing " & _name & "::operation1"
  
  raiseEvent( _
    OperationCompleted, _
    OperationCompletedEventArgs( _someInternalState ) )
end sub

sub _
  Object1.operation2()
  
  ? "Performing " & _name & "::operation2"
  
  raiseEvent( _
    SomethingHappened, _
    SomethingHappenedEventArgs( "An error occurred." ) )
end sub

/'
  And now this class defines another object that will listen to events
  raised from another class.
  
  Note that the class' public interface is completely devoid of any members,
  and that the class does not need to store a reference to the observed class.
  All it really needs to do is adding handlers for the events its observer will
  raise.
'/
type _
  Object2 _
  extends Events.WithEvents
  
  public:
    declare constructor( _
      byref as Object1 )
    declare destructor() override
  
  private:
    declare constructor()
    
    declare static sub _
      object1_OperationCompleted( _
        byref as Object, _
        byref as OperationCompletedEventArgs )
    declare static sub _
      object1_SomethingHappened( _
        byref as Object, _
        byref as SomethingHappenedEventArgs )
      
    declare sub _
      reportOperation( _
        byref as const string, _
        byval as integer )
    declare sub _
      reportSomethingHappened( _
        byref as const string, _
        byref as const string )
end type

constructor _
  Object2()
end constructor

constructor _
  Object2( _
    byref aSubject as Object1 )
  
  addHandler( _
    aSubject.OperationCompleted, _
    asHandler( object1_operationCompleted ) )
  
  addHandler( _
    aSubject.SomethingHappened, _
    asHandler( object1_somethingHappened ) )
end constructor

/'
  Also note that manually removing handlers is not needed, as this is taken
  care of automatically by the base class. All that is really needed is to
  override the destructor.
'/
destructor _
  Object2()
end destructor

sub _
  Object2.object1_operationCompleted( _
    byref sender as Object, _
    byref e as OperationCompletedEventArgs )
  
  var _
    instance => cptr( Object2 ptr, e.Me )
  
  instance->reportOperation( _
    cptr( Object1 ptr, @sender )->name, _
    e.someData )
end sub

sub _
  Object2.object1_somethingHappened( _
    byref sender as Object, _
    byref e as SomethingHappenedEventArgs )
  
  var _
    instance => cptr( Object2 ptr, e.Me )
  
  instance->reportSomethingHappened( _
    cptr( Object1 ptr, @sender )->name, _
    e.message )
end sub

sub _
  Object2.reportOperation( _
    byref aName as const string, _
    byval aState as integer )
  
  ? "Operation has been completed on " & aName & _
    ". State received: " & aState
end sub

sub _
  Object2.reportSomethingHappened( _
    byref aName as const string, _
    byref aMessage as const string )
  
  ? "Something happened on " & aName & _
    ". Message: " & aMessage
end sub

scope
  /'
    Example code
  '/
  var _
    anObject => Object1( "AnObject" ), _
    anotherObject => Object1( "AnotherObject" )
  
  /'
    'anObserver' is going to handle the events of the 'anObject' instance. Note
    that, even though both instances will indeed raise events, only the events
    raised by 'anObject' will be handled.
  '/
  var _
    anObserver => Object2( anObject )
  
  anObject.operation1()
  ?
  anotherObject.operation1()
  
  ?
  anObject.operation2()
