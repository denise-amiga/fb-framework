# fb-framework
A framework to develop apps, for FreeBasic 1.07.1+

Currently a WIP, but the public interface is mostly stable by now.

Included so far are:

* A templating framework
* A small set of templatable collections
* An events framework to create classes that can raise and respond to events, VB.NET style
* A Xml framework to read Xml files
* A little framework to work with easings and other interpolation functions

To be added:

* A tasks framework to lay out concurrent tasks
* A graphics framework to abstract several graphics backends (SDL, Cairo, etc)
* A math framework
* Many more

## Install instructions
Just merge the contents of the `/inc` folder into the one of your own FreeBasic installation. The `/examples` folder contains some examples on how to use the different frameworks.
