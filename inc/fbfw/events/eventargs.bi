namespace Events
  /'
    Represents an event that has no arguments. All events are derived
    from this class.
    
    Note that there's a public 'Me' member. This member is equivalent
    to the 'this' pointer and is needed to access the members of the
    class that registered the listener. There's no need to set it
    manually, as it will be forwarded to the listener by the 'WithEvents'
    class.
