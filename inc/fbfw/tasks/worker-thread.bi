    A worker thread of execution. 
    
    Worker threads are under the control of a Task Manager, that assigns tasks
    to them according to their availability and workload. They are not
    designed to be used standalone, and the user does not need to deal with
    it directly.

    The main loop of a WorkingThread. The main loop works like this:
    
    Upon entering the loop, the thread is flagged as 'idle' and becomes
    spinlocked, waiting for a conditional signal.
    The conditional signal comes from a TaskManager, which assigns the
    thread the next Task in its internal queue and signals the conditional.
    This causes the thread to exit from the spinlock and execute the Task
    assigned, and upon finishing it tells its TaskManager that it has
    finished the Task assigned. The TaskManager then signals the conditional
    for the thread again, which in turn causes the WorkerThread to be
    spinlocked again, waiting for another task assignment.
  '/
  sub _
    WorkerThread.run( _
      byval instance as WorkerThread ptr )
    
    do
      instance->lock()

      instance->_idle => true
      
      dim as double _
        idleTime => timer()
      
      /'
        Puts the thread to sleep if it's idle. Note that the conditional
        is wrapped up in a loop ('spinlocked'), to prevent spurious wakeups.
        
        While in this sleeping state, the thread doesn't use any CPU cycles.
      '/

        If a Task is assigned to this thread, change its idle status
        and perform the Task that was attached to it.

    and the thread is put to sleep through a conditional.

    Detaches the Task assigned to the thread. Note that the
    thread DOES NOT dispose of the Task.
