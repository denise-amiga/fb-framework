    The Task Manager class.
    
    This class maintains a series of sleeping threads, which are awakened when
    there's a task queued. It's in charge of distributing tasks across available
    threads, and also takes care of their lifetimes.
    
    If there are no more pending tasks on the queue when a thread completes a task,
    it is sent to sleep, awaiting for more tasks to come. Sleeping threads do not
    consume any resources, nor use any CPU cycles.
    
    ATTENTION: Do note that there's a constructor definition missing, which is
    placed after the WorkerThread definition, because we can't forward define
    WorkerThreads as FreeBasic doesn't support that kind of forward references.

    Add a task to the tail of the task queue. Working threads
    remove tasks from the fringe of it.
    
    If the task is running, it will get queued immediately to
    the pending tasks queue. On the other hand, if the task is
    suspended, it will get queued into the suspended tasks queue,
    awaiting for its owner to resume it.
