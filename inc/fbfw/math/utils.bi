    Returns the angle between two vectors using the dot product, in
    radians.
    
    Note that the result of the dot product used here should,
    mathematically speaking, always give a result between -1 and 1.
    Due to imprecisions of numerical calculations it might sometimes
    be a little bit outside this range however (especially if you define
    Scalar to be float instead of float). If that happens, the acos
    function will give an invalid result. So instead a protection was
    added that sets the value back to 1 or -1 (because, if the value
    became 1.0000023 for example, it was probably supposed to be 1
    anyway).
